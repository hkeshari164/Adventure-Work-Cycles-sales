Data Cleaning, Preprocessing, Modelling, Analysis and Data Visualisation: Microsoft power BI was adopted to solve these problems.
The data was imported and first transformed in the power query, for instance the yearly sales were in separate files and needed to be appended. 
Additional columns were also created on the date table such as Month, month name, year etc. After making necessary transformation the 
data was modelled using by connecting the dimension tables to the facts table in other to form a star schema. The data was then analysed and 
visualized to address the business problems. Please see each of the figures to further understand the analysis.

Business Problems
Adventure Works Cycles is a large and rapidly growing multinational manufacturer and seller of bicycles and accessories to commercial markets. 
In order to evaluate the company’s performance, their current marketing strategy’s effectiveness and to identify areas for marketing process 
improvement I was given the responsibility to analyse their Sales Data. Adventure Works Cycles needs a way 
to track KPIs (sales, revenue, profit, returns), compare regional performance, analyse product-level trends and forecasts, and identify high-value customers 
and to have answers to the following questions.

Summary of Findings

* In terms of sub-category, Tires and Tubes , Helmets, Road-Bikes are the top 3 performing products in terms of total orders.

* Water Bottle was the top product that drove the most orders, while Mountain-200-black Bike generated the most profit.

* Bikes generated the most revenue ( 17 Million) among all the 3 categories.

* Overall, we can see that monthly revenue is increasing at an average pace of almost 2.5% month on month. But in some cases, there is a little dip on monthly orders but that can be improved by running promotional offers on top performing products.

* Weekly profit over the time period showed an upward trend. But this can be improved by reducing the return rate.

* From the findings it is seen that United States generated the most Revenue, Orders and Profit followed by Australia. So, more focus should be given to these countries to improve Revenues and Profits.
